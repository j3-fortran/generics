Subject: Miscellaneous edits to incorporate templates
Date: 2024-February-28

Reference:

1. Introduction
===============

This paper describes many edits to the standard that will be required
in order to incorporate the syntax and semantics for templates. this is
not intended to be an exhaustive listing, but describes those that have
been identified so far.

2. Edits required for deferred arguments
========================================

* Insert new glossary term after 3.38.2

  [named deferred constant]
  named data object with the CONSTANT attribute (????)

* 7.3.2.1 Type specifier syntax

  Extend R702 <type-spec>:
  " <<or>> <deferred-type>"

  Extend R703 <declaration-type-spec>:
  "TYPE(<deferred-type>)"

  Extend R703 <declaration-type-spec>:
  "CLASS(<deferred-class>)"

* 7.5.2.1 Syntax of a derived-type definition

  New constraint or R728:
  "<parent-type-name> shall not be a <deferred-type>.

* 8.5.8.1 General

  Change last entry for <array-spec>

  From:
      <<or>>   <assumed-rank-spec>

  To:
      <<or>>   <assumed-or-deferred-rank-spec>

* 8.5.8.2 Explicit-shape array

Note:

It may be better to modify <explicit-shape-bounds-spec> to
disambiguate <explicit-bounds-expr> for lower and upper bounds.  This
would make constraint for deferred constants clearer.


* 8.5.8.7 Assumed-rank entity

  Changes title of section to "Assumed-rank or deferred-rank entity."

  Delete <assumed-rank-spec> and add
  <assumed-or-deferred-rank-spec>  <<is>> ..

  (Change all <assumed-rank-spec> throughout the document.)

  Add new constraint:

  Constraint:  A deferred-rank entity shall be a <deferred-const>.

* 8.5.17  RANK clause

  Replace constraint C864 which states:

     An entity declared with a rank-clause shall be a dummy data
     object or have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute.

  With:

     An entity declared with a rank-clause shall be a named constant,
     dummy data object or have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute.

* 10.1.12 Constant expression

  Extend list in normative text for "constant expression":
  "deferred constant"

* 10.1 Expressions and Assignment

  New section 10.1.13 Deferred constant expressions

  <deferred-const-expr> <<is>> <constant-expr>

  An expression is a <deferred-const-expr> if one of its primaries is
  a named deferred constant.

  A <deferred-const-expr> is not equal to any other <expr> unless
  <expr> is syntactically equivalent.

* 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference

  Extend R1522 <procedure-designator>:
  " <<or>> <deferred-proc>"
  " <<or>> <inline-instantiate>"

  Extend R1524 <actual-arg>:
  " <<or>> <deferred-proc> "

3. Edits required for templates and instantiation
=================================================

* 5.1 High level syntax

  Extend R508 <specification-construct> to include:
        <<or>> <template>
        <<or>> <requirement>
        <<or>> <instantiate-stmt>

  Extend R512 to be:
     R512 <internal-subprogram>
         <<is>> <function-subprogram>
         <<or>> <subroutine-subprogram>
         <<or>> <simple-template-subroutine-subprogram>
         <<or>> <simple-template-function-subprogram>

*8.7 IMPLICIT Statement

Modify last sentence in para 3 on page 127 from:

If a mapping is not specified for a letter, the default
for a program unit or an interface body is default integer if the
letter is I, J, ..., or N and default real otherwise, and the default
for a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module subprogram is
the mapping in the host scoping unit.

To:

If a mapping is not specified for a letter, the default for a program
unit or an interface body that does not appear in a template or a
requirement is default integer if the letter is I, J, ..., or N and
default real otherwise.  The default for a BLOCK construct, internal
subprogram, or module subprogram is the mapping in the host scoping
unit.  The default for an interface body inside of a template or
requirement is as if IMPLICIT NONE(TYPE, EXTERNAL) appeared.


* 8.8p2 IMPORT Statement

  Modify sentence 2 in p2 from:

     This is the default for an interface body that is not a module
     procedure interface body.

     To:

     This is the default for an interface body that is not a module
     procedure interface body or an interface body that appears in a
     template or a requirement.

  Modify sentence 2 in p4 from:

     This is the default for a derived-type definition, internal
     subprogram, module procedure interface body, module subprogram,
     or submodule.

  To:

     This is the default for a derived-type definition, internal
     subprogram, module procedure interface body, module subprogram,
     submodule, or an interface body that appears in a template or a
     requirement.

* 14.2.1 Module syntax and semantics

Rule 1408 becomes

R1408 <module-subprogram>
    <<is>> <function-subprogram>
    <<or>> <subroutine-subprogram>
    <<or>> <separate-module-subprogram>
    <<or>> <simple-template-subroutine-subprogram>
    <<or>> <simple-template-function-subprogram>
