1. Introduction
===============

This paper provides references to a series of detailed examples that
exercise generics features supported by the generics subgroup.  These
examples are hosted on GitHub and evolve over time.


2. Examples
===========

The examples listed here are (roughly) in order of increasing complexity.

A. Swap

   https://github.com/j3-fortran/generics/tree/main/examples/swap

   This example shows how one might write a template that supports
   swap on scalars of arbitrary Fortran types.  A variant template is
   provided that tases an additional integer parameter to support swap
   of arrays in a rank-agnostic manner.

   Each template provides additional procedures to cover the case
   of swapping pointers and allocatables.


B. Instrinsics

   https://github.com/j3-fortran/generics/tree/main/examples/intrinsics

   This example shows how one may write templates that provide similar
   functionality as that of various Fortran intrinsic procedures but extended
   across arbitrary types.   We expect this example to grow over time to
   cover an increasing subset of Fortran intrinsics.

C. Functional iteration

   https://github.com/j3-fortran/generics/tree/main/examples/functional_iteration

   This example shows how to implement scan() and fold() for arrays of
   arbitrary type given a binary operation.

D. Vector (container)

   https://github.com/j3-fortran/generics/tree/main/examples/vector

   This example shows how to to use a template to define a vector
   container (similar to a list container) for arbitrary Fortran type.
   The primary template provides a vector type and an iterator type
   with various methods for manipulation.

   The module also provides a "inner" template 'find_tmpl' which takes
   an additional comparison procedure parameter to produce af find()
   procedure that can search a container.  (In a more robust system,
   find_tmpl would be completely separate and have 4 parameters:
   element type, container type, iterator type, and comparison
   procedure.)

E. Block matrix multiply

   https://github.com/j3-fortran/generics/tree/main/examples/matmul

   This example shows how a template can be used to produce a matmul
   procedure for block matrices.   The driver demonstrates use on:
       (1) matmul of ordinary Fortran arrays
       (2) matmul on arrays whose elements are blocks
       (3) matmul on arrays whose elements are blocks of blocks

   This example also makes use of an inner procedure to induce a
   reduce() method on the BlockMatrix type that encapsulates an array
   of elements on a type that has its own reduce() method.
