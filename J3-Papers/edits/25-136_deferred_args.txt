tt.4 Deferred arguments

tt.4.1 Declarations of deferred arguments

tt.4.1.1 General

A deferred argument is an entity whose identifier appears in a
<deferred-arg-name-list> in a template, requirement, or templated
procedure.  A deferred argument can be a constant, procedure, or type.
A deferred argument becomes associated with an instantiation argument
through instantiation of a template, requirement, or templated procedure
as described in tt.6.

A deferred argument declaration statement is used to declare
deferred arguments.

Rtt02 <deferred-arg-decl-stmt>
          <<is>> <deferred-type-declaration-stmt>
          <<or>> <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>
          <<or>> <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt>
          <<or>> <require-stmt>

NOTE

    Deferred arguments are local identifiers and are not externally
    accessible.

tt.4.1.2 Deferred types

A deferred type is a deferred argument that can appear in a type
specifier within a REQUIREMENT construct, TEMPLATE construct, or
templated procedure.

Rtt04 <deferred-type-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
         DEFERRED TYPE[, <deferred-type-attr-list>] ::
         <deferred-type-name-list>

Ctt04 (Rtt04) Each <deferred-type-name> shall be the name of a deferred
              argument of the scoping unit in which the declaration
              appears.

Rtt05 <deferred-type-attr> <<is>> ABSTRACT
                           <<or>> EXTENSIBLE

Ctt05 (Rtt05) Only one of ABSTRACT or EXTENSIBLE shall appear.

Ctt06 (Rtt05) The same <deferred-type-attr> shall not appear more than
              once in a given <deferred-type-attr-list>.

Ctt07 The name of a deferred type shall not appear as a
      <parent-type-name> in a <type-attr-spec>.

Ctt08 A variable of deferred type shall not be a coarray.

A deferred type with the EXTENSIBLE attribute is an extensible type. A
deferred type with the ABSTRACT attribute is an abstract type. A deferred
type with the ABSTRACT attribute implicitly has the EXTENSIBLE
attribute.

NOTE 1

    A deferred type cannot be extended. The use of the term "extensible"
    is to imply a restriction on the associated instantiation argument.

NOTE 2

    Even with the EXTENSIBLE attribute, a deferred type cannot be
    constructed because it has unspecified components and type
    parameters within the template.

NOTE 3

    Examples of deferred type declarations are:

        DEFERRED TYPE :: T1
        DEFERRED TYPE, EXTENSIBLE :: T2
        DEFERRED TYPE, ABSTRACT :: T3

NOTE 4

    The distinction between deferred types that are extensible or
    not, and deferred types that are abstract or not, helps to ensure
    a processor can verify a template is internally consistent.  For
    example, a deferred type cannot be used in a CLASS declaration if
    it might be instantiated as INTEGER.  Likewise, a deferred type
    cannot be used in a TYPE declaration if it might be instantiated
    with an abstract type.

    Using the deferred type declarations from NOTE 3, the following
    examples of type declaration statements are valid or invalid as
    marked:

        TYPE(T1)  :: A1   ! Valid
        CLASS(T1) :: A2   ! Invalid

        TYPE(T2)  :: B1   ! Valid
        CLASS(T2) :: B2   ! Valid

        TYPE(T3)  :: C1   ! Invalid
        CLASS(T3) :: C2   ! Valid

NOTE 5

    Variables of deferred type are not permitted to be coarrays because
    it is invalid to coindex a variable that has polymorphic ultimate
    components, and instantiation arguments are permitted to have
    polymorphic ultimate components.  Straightforward workarounds are
    possible using deferred procedures.

{
Future work could relax Ctt08 while introducing a "intrinsic requirement"
that specifies that the type does not have allocatable components. And
this would be checked at instantiate.
}

tt.4.1.3 Deferred constants

A deferred constant is a deferred argument that can appear in constant
expressions within a REQUIREMENT construct, TEMPLATE construct, or
templated procedure.

Rtt06 <deferred-const-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
           DEFERRED <declaration-type-spec>,
                 <deferred-const-attr-spec-list> ::
                 <deferred-const-entity-decl-list>

Rtt07 <deferred-const-attr-spec> <<is>> DIMENSION(<array-spec>)
                                 <<or>> PARAMETER
                                 <<or>> <rank-clause>

Rtt08 <deferred-const-entity-decl>
          <<is>> <deferred-const-name> [ ( <array-spec> ) ]

Ctt09 (Rtt06) The <deferred-const-attr-spec-list> shall include
              PARAMETER.

Ctt10 (Rtt07) An entity declared in <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>
              shall be INTEGER, LOGICAL, or assumed-length CHARACTER.

Ctt11 (Rtt08) Each <deferred-const-name> shall be the name of a deferred
              argument of the scoping unit in which the declaration
              appears.

Ctt12 (Rtt06) If <array-spec> appears in
              <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>, it shall be
              <implied-shape-spec>, <assumed-or-implied-rank-spec>,
              <explicit-shape-spec-list>, or
              <explicit-shape-bounds-spec>.

Ctt13 (Rtt06) If <implied-shape-spec>, <explicit-shape-spec> or
              <explicit-shape-bounds-spec> appears in
              <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>, then <lower-bound>
              shall not be specified.

Ctt14 (Rtt06) If <explicit-shape-bounds-spec> appears in
              <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>, then
              <lower-explicit-bounds-expr> shall not appear.

NOTE 1

    Deferred constant arrays always have default lower bounds.  This
    restriction ensures consistency of lower-bounds when reusing
    requirements.

{

 Subgroup prefers to disallow explicit confirmation of default lower
 bounds because we envision that there may be a useful distinction to
 be made in the future between specified lower bounds and default
 lower bounds.

}


NOTE 2

    Examples of deferred constant declarations are:

    ! explicit shape
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER  :: x1
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER :: x2(3)
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER :: v1(2) = [5,15] ! not a deferred constant
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER  :: x3(v1)

    ! implied shape
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER :: x4(*)
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER :: x5(*,*)
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER, RANK(2) :: x6

    ! assumed-or-implied-rank-spec
    DEFERRED INTEGER, PARAMETER :: x7(..)

tt.4.1.4 Deferred procedures

A deferred procedure is a deferred argument that can appear as the
procedure designator of a procedure reference within a REQUIREMENT
construct, TEMPLATE construct, or templated procedure.  A deferred
procedure's interface is established in that construct by its appearance
in a <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt> or as the <subroutine-name> or
<function-name> of an <interface-body> that appears in a deferred
interface block.

Rtt09 <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
     DEFERRED PROCEDURE(<interface>) [ :: ] <deferred-proc-name-list>

Ctt15 (Rtt09) Each <deferred-proc-name> shall be the name of a deferred
              argument of the scoping unit in which the declaration
              appears.

Ctt16 Each <subroutine-name> or <function-name> of an <interface-body>
      that appears in a deferred interface block shall be the name of
      a deferred argument of the scoping unit in which the
      <interface-body> appears.

NOTE 1

    The interface of a deferred procedure may be defined in terms of
    other deferred arguments.

NOTE 2

    The following example declares deferred procedures F, S, and G.
    The declaration of G is in terms of an interface F_I.


        DEFERRED TYPE :: T
        DEFERRED INTERFACE
           FUNCTION F(X)
              TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: X
              TYPE(T) :: F
           END FUNCTION
           SUBROUTINE S(Y)
              TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: Y
           END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
        DEFERRED PROCEDURE(F_I) :: G
