Subject: Rank-agnostic nested loops

1. Introduction
===============

The introduction of generics features which allow parameterizations of
an algorithm by the ranks of one or more arrays, is unfortunately
limited in certain important cases.  ELEMENTAL and rank-agnostic
access of array elements handle a great many use cases, but important
capability gaps remain.

I propose that Fortran should be extended to include support for
rank-agnostic nested loops.

UTI:  0-dimensional indexing

2. Use cases
============

The use cases presented here are:
  2.1 Tensor/outer product
  2.2 MINLOC analog
  2.3 user-rolled stuff with assumed-rank (test framework generate
      comparison messages)

2.1 Tensor/outer product
========================

Consider how one might write a template procedure that computes the
outer product of 2 array arguments.  We assume that the template is
parameterized by two integers RA and RB that specify the ranks of the
two arguments A and B.

With the current features planned for Fortran 202X, the user would be
forced to manually implement rather tedious logic for iterating
through a set of indices:

   FUNCTION OUTER_PRODUCT(A, B) RESULT(C)
      REAL, RANK(RA), INTENT(IN) :: A
      REAL, RANK(RB), INTENT(IN) :: B
      REAL, RANK(RA+RB) :: C ! C(I,J) = A(I) * B(J)

      INTEGER :: a_idx(RA)
      INTEGER, POINTER :: b_idx(:)
      INTEGER, POINTER :: c_idx(:)
      LOGICAL :: done

      c_idx = 1

      DO
        C(@c_idx) = A(@c_idx(1:RA)) * B(@c_idx(1:RB))

        c_idx(1:RA) = next_idx(c_idx(1:RA), shape(A), done)
        IF (done) THEN
           a_idx = 1
           c_idx(RA+1:) = next_idx(c_idx(RA+1:), shape(B), done)
           IF (done) EXIT
        END IF
      
      END DO

   CONTAINS

      FUNCTION next_idx(idx, shp, done) result(new_idx)
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: idx(:)
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: shp(:)
          LOGICAL, INTENT(OUT) :: done
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: new_idx(size(idx))

          INTEGER :: m

          done = .FALSE. ! unless

          DO m = 1, SIZE(idx)
             IF (idx(m) < shp(m)) THEN
                new_idx(m) = idx(m) + 1
                RETURN
             ELSE ! 
                IF (m == SIZE(shp)) THEN
                   done = .true.
                   RETURN
                ELSE
                   new_idx(m) = 1
                END IF
             END IF
          END DO
       END FUNCTION next_idx             

   END FUNCTION


2.2 MINLOC analog
=================

The proposed TEMPLATE features in F202Y will in theory allow us to
define a TEMPLATE that implements an intrinsic-like MINLOC function
for rank-N arrays of arbitrary type provided a compare operation.
However, the existing rank agnostic machinery in F2023 makes this more
difficult than one might expect.

Brad Richards has implemented this generalized MINLOC at:
https://github.com/j3-fortran/generics/blob/main/examples/intrinsics/
minloc_m.f90

Much as with the previous use case, the code is particularly complex
due to the need to manually loop through an arbitrary number of
dimensions.



2.3 Assertion library
=====================

Consider the use case where a testing framework wishes to provide an
overloaded assert() function that compares 2 same-shape arrays of rank
N for equality.  If any elements differ, then the procedure produces a
message indicating the location of the first difference and the values
at that location.

This use case is quite similar to that of MINLOC, as it could be
expressed a

SUBROUTINE assert(expected, found)
   REAL, RANK(N), INTENT(IN) :: expected
   REAL, RANK(N), INTENT(IN) :: found

   ASSOCIATE ( loc => FINDLOC(found /= expected) )
      print*,'First difference at location ", loc
      print*,'  Expected: ', expected(@loc)
      print*,'  Found:    ', found(@loc)
   END ASSOCIATE

END SUBROUTINE




3. Suggested simplification
===========================

My suggested approach is weakly analogous to the approach for
rank-agnostic access of array elements.  The index and bounds of a DO
loop would be permited to be a multi-index.

To clarify the syntax consider this simple doubly nested loop:

   INTEGER :: I, J
   DO I = 1, M
      DO J = 1, N
         A(I,J) =  < some expression >
      END DO
   END DO

This could be rewritten as:

   INTEGER :: IJ(2)
   DO @IJ = [1,1]:[M,N]
      A(@IJ) = < some expression >
   END DO


-----------

Now consider the outer product use case

   FUNCTION  OUTER_PRODUCT(A, B) RESULT(C)
       REAL, RANK(RA), INTENT(IN) :: A
       REAL, RANK(RB), INTENT(IN) :: B
       REAL, RANK(RA+RB) :: C   ! C(I,J) = A(I) * B(J)

       INTEGER :: idx(RA+RB)

       DO @idx = 1:[SHAPE(A), SHAPE(B)]
          C(@idx) = A(@idx(1:RA)) * B(@idx(RA+1:))
       END DO

   END FUNCTION

A variant that could exploit some degree of ELEMENTAL optimizations:

   FUNCTION  OUTER_PRODUCT(A, B) RESULT(C)
       REAL, RANK(RA), INTENT(IN) :: A
       REAL, RANK(RB), INTENT(IN) :: B
       REAL, RANK(RA+RB) :: C   ! C(I,J) = A(I) * B(J)

       INTEGER :: idx(RA)

       DO @idx = 1:SHAPE(A)
          C(@idx,@:shape(B)) = A(@idx) * B
       END DO

   END FUNCTION


----------

For the MINLOC case, the suggestion notation would permit the
following much simpler, and arguably clearer, implementation shown
below. (For simplicity, I have omitted the mask and dim arguments.)

TEMPLATE MINLOC_T(T, N, less)
    TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
    INTEGER, CONSTANT :: N
    INTERFACE
       LOGICAL FUNCTION  less(x,y)
           TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: x, y
       END FUNCTION
    END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

   FUNCTION MINLOC(A) RESULT(idx)
      INTEGER :: idx(N)
      TYPE(T), RANK(N), INTENT(IN) :: A

      TYPE(T) :: x_min
      INTEGER :: i(N)

      SELECT RANK (A)
      RANK (0) ! scalar
         idx = 1
      RANK DEFAULT
         idx = 1
         x_min = A(@idx)

         DO @i = 1:SHAPE(A)
            ASSOCIATE( x => A(@i) )
               IF (less(x, x_min)) THEN
                  idx = i
                  x_min = x
               END IF
           END ASSOCIATE
         END DO
      END SELECT RANK

   END FUNCTION

END TEMPLATE

===END===
