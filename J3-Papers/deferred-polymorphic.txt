1. Introduction
===============

The current draft syntax for generics features in F202Y can support
all of the proffered use cases, except those that require polymorphics
for the deferred type.  This paper summarizes the rationale by
generics subgroup for how to support this capability in F202Y.


2. Polymorphic deferred use cases
=================================

Consider a List as a protypical category of container.  A programmer
may wish to declare a list of reals, a list of integers, or a list of
some user-define type.  As shown in previous tutorials, the existing
syntax can adequately support all of these.  But another important use
case is where all of the elements of the list have a declared type T,
but differing dynamic types.  (Here, T is a deferred type argument for
a template.)

In practice, such a user could leverage a (monomorphic) implementation
of the List template by defining a wrapper type:


   TYPE :: Wrapper
      CLASS(MyBaseType), ALLOCATABLE :: item
   END TYPE

And then use Wrapper as the argument to the List template.  In
practice is this is very cumbersome as such a user must wrap or unwrap
arguments to each procedure involving List.    It would be better to allow
the template itself to handle these details.


3. Options for polymorphic deferred
===================================

Subgroup considered the following options for allowing polymorphic
deferred objects:

(1) Implicitly interpret the deferred type T as polymorphic if the
    template references CLASS(T) anywhere in the template.

(2) Introduce _intrinsic_ requirement that indicates that T is
    polymorphic.  These would be requirements that cannot be defined
    by existing syntax.  Nominal syntax would be:

    REQUIRES EXTENSIBLE(T)
    

(3) Introduce variant syntax for declaring a deferred type as
    polymorphic.  E.g., CLASS, DEFERRED :: T


Subgroup did not like option (1) as it could be relatively difficult
for the casual programmer to see whether a deferred type is
polymorphic.  Some obscure usage deep in the source could trigger the
difference.

Subgroup decided that option (2) would be attractive if related
intrinsic requirementsn were also to be introduced.    E.g.,

   REQUIRES TYPE_EXTENDS(T, U) ! differenc that intrinsic EXTENDS_TYPE()
   REQUIRES DIFFERENT_TYPE(T,U) ! allows overload of T & U

While subgroup believes that such intrinsic requirements may prove
desirable in the future, our existing use cases do not clearly show
the need at this time.

Subgroup therefore prefers the more direct approach with option (3).
Our suggested syntax would be:

    CLASS, DEFERRED :: T

4. Implications and consequences
================================

If a template declares a deferred type T as polymorphic, then any
corresponding actual argument shall be a non-extensible type.   I.e.,
the actual type shall not be:

  - intrinsic
  - SEQUENCE
  - BIND(C)
  - etc.
