This document is intended to be a list of requirements that are to be distilled
from the various use cases.   Ideally this will drive the creation of a formal
paper for generics that will be submitted to the Fortran committee.

Each requirement should specify one or more motivating use cases.


* The generics facility should provide a mechanism that enables
  encapsulation of type, kind, and rank as a single template
  parameter.

  Note: Needs citation to use cases.
